### Cisco Email Security Appliance

[The Cisco Email Security Appliance](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/feature/Cisco-Email-Security-Appliance-Product-overview) is an email security gateway product. It is designed to detect and block a wide variety of email-borne threats, such as malware, spam and phishing attempts. Because so many of today's attacks occur through email messages, having an email security gateway has become a necessity for most organizations.

### Cisco Security Management Appliance
