# Getting the system ready and loading the data

**Specifications :**&#x20;

* Python
* pandas
* seaborn
* sklearn

## Data  <a href="#c8a8" id="c8a8"></a>

For this problem, we have three CSV files: train, test, and sample submission.

* [Train file](https://github.com/mridulrb/Predict-loan-eligibility-using-IBM-Watson-Studio/blob/master/Dataset/train\_ctrUa4K.csv) will be used for training the model, i.e. our model will learn from this file. It contains all the independent variables and the target variable.
* [Test file](https://github.com/mridulrb/Predict-loan-eligibility-using-IBM-Watson-Studio/blob/master/Dataset/test\_lAUu6dG.csv) contains all the independent variables, but not the target variable. We will apply the model to predict the target variable for the test data.
* [Sample submission file](https://github.com/mridulrb/Predict-loan-eligibility-using-IBM-Watson-Studio/blob/master/Dataset/sample\_submission\_49d68Cx.csv) contains the format in which we have to submit out predictions
