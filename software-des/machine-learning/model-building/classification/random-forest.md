# Random Forest

RandomForest is a tree-based bootstrapping algorithm wherein a certain no. of weak learners (decision trees) are combined to make a powerful prediction model.

* For every individual learner, a random sample of rows and a few randomly chosen variables are used to build a decision tree model.
* Final prediction can be a function of all the predictions made by the individual learners.
* In the case of a regression problem, the final prediction can be the mean of all the predictions.
