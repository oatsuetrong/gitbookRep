# Decision Tree

Decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm(having a pre-defined target variable) that is mostly used in classification problems. In this technique, we split the population or sample into two or more homogeneous sets(or sub-populations) based on the most significant splitter/differentiator in input variables.

Decision trees use multiple algorithms to decide to split a node into two or more sub-nodes. The creation of sub-nodes increases the homogeneity of resultant sub-nodes. In other words, we can say that purity of the node increases with respect to the target variable.
