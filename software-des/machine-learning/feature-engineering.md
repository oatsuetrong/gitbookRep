  Based on the domain knowledge, we can come up with new features that might
  affect the target variable. We will create the following three new features:

# Feature Engineering

* **Total Income** — As discussed during bivariate analysis we will combine the Applicant Income and Co-applicant Income. If the total income is high, the chances of loan approval might also be high.
* **EMI** — EMI is the monthly amount to be paid by the applicant to repay the loan. The idea behind making this variable is that people who have high EMI’s might find it difficult to pay back the loan. We can calculate the EMI by taking the ratio of the loan amount with respect to the loan amount term.
* **Balance Income** — This is the income left after the EMI has been paid. The idea behind creating this variable is that if this value is high, the chances are high that a person will repay the loan and hence increasing the chances of loan approval.
