# NAT Gatewayâ€‹

A public NAT gateway allows cloud servers in a VPC to share EIPs for Internet access, which keeps costs down while also improving security by hiding your servers behind EIPs. A private NAT gateway translates IP addresses between your VPC and your on-premises data center or another VPC, allowing you to keep legacy networks unchanged after migrating some of your workloads to the cloud.
